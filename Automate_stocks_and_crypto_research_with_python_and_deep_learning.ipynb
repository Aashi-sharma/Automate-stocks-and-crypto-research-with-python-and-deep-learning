The Bank of Israel said its banking supervision department had completed the inspection process for the new institution named Esh Bank Israel. The approvals, it said, will allow the founders to move forward and complete the mechanical, operational and regulatory preparations required for the start of the bank\\'s activities. These include completing the development and testing phases of new technology and hiring a management team and bank staff. It will take about a year and a half to get the bank up and running, the central bank said. \"We have a long way to go,\" said Shmuel Hauser, the chairman of Esh, adding the bank would offer attractive interest rates and banking services without commissions. Last January, One Zero Digital Bank received final regulatory approval for a full banking licence, becoming the first new Israeli bank in 43 years. Israel\\'s banking system is highly concentrated and run by a handful of banks, with the two largest controlling more than half the assets in the sector. \"We see great importance in the entry of banks and additional new players into the banking system in Israel, so that they contribute to increasing competition and innovation in the financial system,\" said Bank of Israel Governor Amir Yaron.

So in 2021, I decided to dabble in the meme-stock craze that was upending Wall Street and making some gutsy day-traders rich. Gaming retailer GameStop (GME) was the first meme stock, with trader Keith Gill first making the case for why the stock could skyrocket in August of 2020, on the Reddit channel WallStreetBets. Almost nobody noticed Gill’s pitch until the stock did, in fact, blast off five months later. Part of Gill’s strategy was looking for beaten-down stocks with high levels of short interest and bet on a “short squeeze” that could trigger an exponential rise in the stock price. It happened. Before Gill’s pitch, GME traded at around $1. It drifted up slowly toward the end of 2020 and then went crazy, peaking at a closing price of $87 on January 27, 2021. More remarkable than the gain was the fact that it appeared to have nothing to do with GME’s financial performance, which was dismal. Instead, ordinary retail investors organizing on social media seem to have sent the price soaring simply by swarming into the stock and creating a surge in demand. Movie-chain AMC (AMC) came next. Right around the time GME peaked, AMC’s stock started to reverse a four-year decline and get frothy. The stock jumped from a closing low of $1.98 in early January of 2021 to nearly $20 just three weeks later. It wobbled for awhile, then exploded, peaking at $64 on June 2, 2021. The gradual end of the COVID pandemic might have been bullish for the stock, since people would start going to the movies again. But that didn’t explain a 31-fold ascent in the stock price. AMC was still a giant money-loser, with no near-term prospects for turning a profit. Again, a throng of crowdsourced buyers seemed to have driven the surge. [Did you lose money on meme stocks? We'd love to hear your story.] This is around the time I got interested. I’m not as dumb as I might\",\n",

              "  'GameStop Chairman Ryan Cohen and CEO Matt Furlong promised to turn the gaming retailer into one of operational excellence and amazing store experiences while cashing in on new opportunities like crypto and NFTs. More than a year into their collective and rather secretive leadership, the entire experiment is beginning to look like an utter failure — underscoring longtime Wall Street concerns about the company\\'s business model such as too many costly physical stores in dying malls and shifts to digital gaming. Not helping GameStop\\'s turnaround efforts is a complete crash in the once thriving digital asset market that Cohen and Furlong were banking on (see: the NFT market crash or GameStop\\'s strategic partnership with now-defunct FTX). The realities of this underwhelming turnaround story were on grand display in GameStop\\'s third quarter earnings out Wednesday evening. The damage came in two forms. First, another dreadfully poor quarter of financials: Net sales -8.5% year over year. Sales down in the hardware/accessories and software businesses — these businesses have represented about 82% of GameStop\\'s year to date sales. Sales down in the United States, Canada, Australia, and Europe. Gross profit margins unchanged year over year. $95 million adjusted operating loss. Year to date, GameStop has lost $354.9 million on an adjusted operating basis. Total cash of about $1 billion, down from $1.4 billion in the year ago quarter. The other aspect — which is now only taking form — is GameStop dialing back the capital its investing to alter the course of its business longer-term. The pivot amounts to a complete about-face after several ugly quarters that have sent the volatile stock price plunging 40% in 2022. \"Today, we\\'re in the process of aligning corporate costs to our go-forward needs after completing the majority of necessary upgrades to our systems, fulfillment capabilities and overall foundation,\" Furlong said in another relatively short — 8 minutes — earnings call. \"A large portion of our cost cuts will stem from reductions in corporate headcount that have been made during the back-half of this calendar year. In some cases individuals who helped us complete key initiatives have',\n",
              "  'GRAPEVINE, Texas, December 07, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) (\"GameStop\" or the \"Company\") today released financial results for the third quarter ended October 29, 2022. The Company’s condensed and consolidated financial statements, including GAAP and non-GAAP results, are below. The Company’s Form 10-Q and supplemental information can be found at http://investor.GameStop.com. THIRD QUARTER OVERVIEW Net sales were $1.186 billion, compared to $1.297 billion in the prior year\\'s third quarter. Sales attributable to new and expanded brand relationships were strong in the quarter, while sales in the collectibles category remained strong on a year-to-date basis. Selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") were $387.9 million, or 32.7% of sales, compared to $421.5 million, or 32.5% of sales, in the prior year\\'s third quarter. Notably, SG&A as a percentage of revenue was down on a sequential basis from 34.1% in Q2 of this year, reflecting the Company’s ongoing cost reduction efforts. Inventory was $1.131 billion at the close of the period, compared to $1.141 billion at the close of the prior year\\'s third quarter. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $1.042 billion at the close of the third quarter. Long-term debt remains limited to a low-interest, unsecured term loan associated with the French government’s response to COVID-19. CONFERENCE CALL INFORMATION The Company will host an investor conference call today, December 7, 2022, at 5:00 pm ET to review its financial results.

A recording of the conference call will be made available on the Company’s investor relations website for two months. NON-GAAP MEASURES AND OTHER METRICS As a supplement to the Company’s financial results presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), GameStop may use certain non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted SG&A, adjusted operating income (loss), adjusted net income (loss), adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow. The Company believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors in evaluating the Company’s core operating performance. Adjusted selling,',\n",
              "  \"Insiders were net buyers of GME Resources Limited's (ASX:GME ) stock during the past year. That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold. While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.  Check out our latest analysis for GME Resources  In the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when MD & Director Paul Kopejtka bought AU$100k worth of shares at a price of AU$0.084 per share. Although we like to see insider buying, we note that this large purchase was at significantly below the recent price of AU$0.095. Because it occurred at a lower valuation, it doesn't tell us much about whether insiders might find today's price attractive. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date! There are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them). Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It appears that GME Resources insiders own 24% of the company, worth about AU$15m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders. It is good to see the recent insider purchase. And the longer term insider transactions also give us confidence. However, we note that the company didn't make a profit over the last twelve months, which makes us cautious. Insiders likely see value in GME\",\n",

              "  'The meme stock frenzy may have died down from its fever-pitch levels during the COVID-19 pandemic, but there continues to be a wide swath of supporters for companies that are far from fundamentally sound and trade with heightened volatility. To that end, Morningstar CEO Kunal Kapoor has a reminder to the growing retail investor community still playing stocks such as AMC (AMC), GameStop (GME), and Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY) in the hopes of quick and easy gains: Please use extra caution and think about long-term investing approaches. \"My hope is that even as maybe people have been using some of their fun money, so to speak, to do some of the meme stock investing or maybe investing in crypto or what have you, that the serious part of their investing is really starting to transition to things that over time help them build wealth,\" Kapoor said in a new Yahoo Finance Presents episode. There are small signs that retail investors are looking to practice Kapoor\\'s more disciplined approach in 2023. About 64.3% of those polled in a new Finimize survey say they will take any surplus income next year and buy shares of mega-cap tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta (META), and Netflix (NFLX). In other words, the individual investor appears to be hunting for value in predictable businesses now trading at steep discounts to their historical valuations. The rest of the respondents mostly plan to dabble in software and renewable energy names as well as other companies that are fundamentally sound. Meanwhile, 85% of those polled have never bought a meme stock, according to Finimize\\'s survey. It\\'s hard to see this dynamic shifting — i.e., no new supporters for these meme stocks — if the economy slows further, hammers these risky names even more, and causes some meme stock believers to finally toss in the towel. The performance of meme stocks this year helps explains the muted appetite for sparking a resurgence in meme names. GameStop reported yet another fundamentally poor third quarter.

The U.S. automaker cancelled the morning shift and told all workers at its most productive manufacturing hub they could start their break, said the people and the notice seen by Reuters. The company did not give a reason. Reuters reported earlier this month that the electric car giant planned to suspend Model Y production at the plant from Dec. 25 to Jan. 1. The suspension comes among a rising wave of infections after China eased its zero-COVID policy earlier this month, an abrupt move welcomed by businesses and the public but heavily disrupting business operations in the short term. One of the people said workers at Tesla and its suppliers have also been falling sick as part of this wave, posing challenges to operations in the past week. Tesla is also grappling with elevated inventory levels as its second largest market braces for a downturn. The Shanghai plant has been focused on making models for export in the last week, the person added. A media representative at Tesla China did not immediately respond to request for comment. The plant’s suspension of Model Y assembly at the end of the month would be part of a cut in planned production of about 30% in the month for the model, Tesla's best-selling model, at the Shanghai factory, Reuters had reported. The Shanghai factory, the most important manufacturing hub for Elon Musk's electric vehicle company, kept normal operations during the last week of December last year.

EvercoreISI analyst Chris McNally slashed his price target on Tesla\\'s stock to $200 from $300 on Tuesday, joining bearish takes in the past week from Goldman Sachs, Wedbush, and Oppenheimer. \"While we continue to view Tesla as having a leading EV gross margin advantage from global scale, vertical integration, and US IRA [Inflation Reduction Act] benefits, it is impossible to ignore that investors are already well aware of these benefits but now must ALSO battle test demand assumptions for 2023-2025,\" McNally said in a new note to clients.

Whether it\\'s 3D printing, biotechnology, or electric cars, Ms. Wood is right at the front of identifying firms that she believes are truly poised to explode. Naturally, this aggressive approach, which can very well be categorized as being disruptive to the hedge fund world as well, has come under criticism from more conservative investors who believe that high risk companies should be balanced out with stable players. Ms. Wood is aware of this criticism. In a research paper that she wrote at the start of this month, Cathie Wood used quantitative data to hit back at the critics. She criticized the approach of simply using the operating income (EBITDA) to value growth companies that are investing heavily in research and development. The hedge fund boss explained that purely focusing on EBITDA — just 27.8% of her Innovation ETF\\'s holdings are EBITDA positive — is not a reliable indicator of performance since research and development ends up adding to the long term value of a firm.

The altcoin kingpin had more than $580 million of BTC stashed with the crypto asset manager at one point in August, according to a private financial document that CoinDesk reviewed. That amounted to over 90% of money at Valkyrie’s largest division, Valkyrie Digital Assets LLC, the document shows. In other words, Valkyrie Investments, a money manager that pitches crypto products to Wall Street investors, mostly relied on Justin Sun, a controversial Chinese crypto billionaire. (The current state of Valkyrie’s assets is unknown.) Sun has also said he’s one of Valkyrie’s biggest shareholders. It’s yet another example of centralization in crypto, an industry rife with whales carrying outsize clout, in spite of its decentralized ideals. Sun’s relationship with Valkyrie popped up in ways that benefitted his empire. For example, Valkyrie built investment products for “Justin tokens” such as Tron’s TRX and BitTorrent BTT that other crypto asset managers say they avoid. It promoted Tron using the blockchain network’s developers’ own marketing materials. It even let Tron share its spotlight on Wall Street – literally – with someone wearing a T-shirt bearing the Tron logo joining Valkyrie’s bell-ringing at Nasdaq in September. The financial lives of individuals are almost always nobody’s business. Sun’s previously undisclosed, outsized percentage of Valkyrie’s assets under management (AUM) is an exception. The depth of the relationship is a matter of public interest because it raises questions about Valkyrie’s reliance on a single client for growth. Sun is a notable and polarizing figure in the crypto industry. He is the founder of the Tron blockchain, which has spawned repeated controversy. Tron issued, for example, an algorithmic stablecoin that researchers derided as a “clone” of the doomed Terra/Luna setup.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) took the opportunity, with crypto top of mind, to react with a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by Sen. Roger Marshall (R-Kan.) called the “Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act.” I’m not going to go over the bill point by point here but, if passed, the bill will require anyone who maintains public blockchain infrastructure to register as a Financial Institution (FI). This includes software developers or anyone validating transactions on a network. These FIs would be required to do things like collect the personal information of people who use their software and comply with anti-money laundering (AML) programs to block funds related to crime. On top of that, it would ban any interaction with privacy tools like Tornado Cash (which is sanctioned by the Treasury Department) and privacy-coin protocols including Monero or Zcash. On its face, the bill doesn’t necessarily feel problematic, especially because it was drafted in wake of the FTX collapse. But here's the thing about the bill: It misses The Point.

The cryptocurrency market has had a turbulent year with personalities like Sam Bankman-Fried brought low and the head of the European Central Bank (ECB) declaring bitcoin (BTC-USD) is on the \"road to irrelevance\". However, others argue that crypto has endured worse in the past and its adoption rate is growing despite an array of bad press. Yahoo finance UK looks back over 2022, a year of \"crypto winter\", where investor nerves were well and truly tested. The cryptocurrency market cap hit a high of over $3tn (£2.46tn) in November 2021, but has now fallen to $904bn, according to data from Statistia. Check: Crypto live prices The capital inflow that swelled the crypto market in November 2021 was composed of mostly retail investors. These same investors took the worst of the damage when the market began to buckle in 2022, when funds were drained from centralised exchanges and lending platforms, which have been operating as the de-facto banks in the largely unregulated and experimental crypto sector. However, after crypto exchange FTX collapsed, dealing a critical hit to the industry\\'s reputation, these \"banks\" look more like casinos, as FTX was reported to have played against its unwitting customers using customers\\' own cash. On New Year\\'s Day 2022, bitcoin and ethereum (ETH-USD) stepped into 2022 trading at $47,000 and $3,800 respectively \\u2060– slightly down from their all-time highs of $68,000 for bitcoin and $4,600 for ethereum in November 2021.

Blockchain is a revolutionary technology that is gaining rapid popularity among various industries. It is a digital ledger of transactions that are stored in a distributed, secure, and immutable manner. It is often referred to as the backbone of cryptocurrencies, but its potential applications go far beyond financial transactions. Blockchain has the potential to revolutionize the way businesses and organizations operate. By using distributed ledger technology, blockchain enables the secure, transparent, and efficient exchange of data and digital assets. It can also be used to create more efficient, secure, and transparent supply chains, reduce operational costs, and improve data security and privacy. As a result, blockchain technology has the potential to increase efficiency, reduce costs, and create better customer experiences. Additionally, the ability to create immutable records on a distributed ledger could revolutionize the way businesses and organizations manage their records and transactions, leading to increased trust and data integrity.\\xa0As the technology continues to evolve, its potential applications are growing exponentially. The global blockchain technology market was worth $5.92 billion in 2021, according to a report by Grand View Research. The market is expected to be worth $10.02 billion by the end of 2022, and then grow at a compound annual growth rate of 85.9% from 2022 through 2030, reaching a value of $1.43 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.\\xa0Primary factors influencing this growth include the hefty investments being poured into blockchain technology by both corporations and venture capitalists.

At least that's what at least one Yahoo Finance in-house metric is revealing as investors continue to check in on beaten-down crypto prices at a high rate as 2022 draws to a close. Despite the entire crypto asset class seemingly teetering on the brink of collapse — or perhaps because of it — the Yahoo Finance bitcoin quote page (BTC-USD) has racked up more than 157 million views so far in 2022, making it #8 on the year's top ten trending tickers list. And this coming during a year that saw war in Europe break out, historic rate hikes from the Fed surprise all summer long, and investors endure the worst environment for the stock market in over a decade. Unsurprisingly, perennial favorite Tesla (TSLA) sits on top of the list. The major U.S. indices, plus Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), also bested bitcoin in terms of clicks. But the leading crypto ticker managed to beat chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA) as well as 2021 favorite GameStop (GME), which rounds out the top ten. Over prior crypto winters, user interest in Yahoo Finance crypto quote pages simply cratered.

Bankman-Fried, who was brought to the U.S. overnight by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after his extradition from the Bahamas court cleared on Wednesday, arrived at the courthouse in New York to face the U.S. felony charges. The case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York centers on accusations of fraud, money laundering and campaign-finance violations. Bankman-Fried\\'s release was secured by equity in his parents\\' Palo Alto, California, home, and a long list of requirements was included for him to remain free while he faces charges. He\\'s not allowed to make financial transactions for more than $1,000, can\\'t open new lines of credit, can\\'t leave the house except to exercise and must go through substance-abuse and mental-health treatment, according to the agreement. The former CEO arrived at court in a crumpled suit jacket, and the sound of his restraints was audible in the quiet courtroom. When asked if he agreed to the conditions of release, he nodded.

              " 'ETH': ['NEW YORK, Dec. 22, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Bit Digital, Inc. (Nasdaq: BTBT) (\"Bit Digital\" or the \"Company\"), a digital asset mining company headquartered in New York, is pleased to announce that it has formally commenced Ethereum staking operations. Bit Digital intends to delegate, or stake, its ETH holdings to an Ethereum validator node to help secure and strengthen the blockchain network. Stakers are compensated for this commitment in the form of a reward of the native network token. This marks an expansion from Bit Digital\\'s core bitcoin mining operation to also validating transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. While the Company remains bullish on bitcoin, and supporting the bitcoin blockchain, it expects to derive revenue from the Ethereum network via validator rewards. The Company\\'s staking operations are enhanced by a new partnership with Blockdaemon, the leading institutional-grade blockchain infrastructure company for node management and staking. Following a similar mechanism to traditional Ethereum staking, Bit Digital will also participate in liquid staking via Portara, the liquid staking protocol developed by Blockdaemon and StakeWise and the first of its kind tailored to institutions. Liquid staking allows participants to 1) achieve greater capital efficiency by utilizing their staked ETH as collateral and 2) withdraw from staked positions earlier than natively possible by trading their staked ETH tokens on the secondary market. Unlike other liquid staking solutions, Portara\\'s key differentiator is that it ensures that users can only interact with verified counterparties. As a result, several regulated institutions which were previously unable to participate in liquid staking have now on-boarded with Portara and are actively liquid staking. As of December 20, the Company had 7,904 ETH and 2,004 sETH-h with a combined worth of approximately $12.1 million. 2,164 ETH were actively staked as of that date, using either native staking or liquid staking protocols. The Company intends to continue accumulating Ethereum and stake substantially all of its ETH position over time. Bryan Bullett, Bit Digital\\'s CEO, commented: \"We are excited to expand from our core bitcoin mining business into validating transactions on the Ethereum blockchain.

A new report from blockchain risk monitoring firm Solidus Labs shows that fraudsters deployed over 117,000 scam tokens from Jan. 1 to Dec. 1, 2022, a 41% increase over the full 2021. The study also revealed that 8% of all Ethereum tokens are programmed to execute rug pulls, while 12% of all BNB Chain tokens are alleged to be scams. According to Solidus Labs, many of the scammers behind these tokens use crypto-to-fiat exchanges to both seed their scams and launder their proceeds. “These fraudsters – benefiting from the fact that more than 99% of their malicious tokens have evaded detection under traditional approaches to scam identification – deposited and withdrew a combined $11 billion worth of ETH to/from 153 different centralized finance [CeFi] exchanges during the time period we studied,” the report read. The scam tokens deployed in 2022 brings the total since September 2020 to more than 200,000, based on the tally by Solidus Labs. Almost 2 million investors have lost funds to rug pull tokens.

              "  '\"Revenue is nice, but integrity trumps all,\" said Ray Youssef, announcing ether\\'s (ETH) removal from the marketplace he founded and runs. Among the reasons for the move noted by Youssef was the Ethereum network\\'s switch to proof-of-stake validation from proof-of-work. \"Proof-of-work is the innovation that makes bitcoin (BTC) the only honest money there is, whereas proof-of-stake has rendered ETH essentially a digital form of fiat,\" he claimed. ETH is \"controlled by a small number of people and one day you will need permission to use it,\" he continued. Youssef also cited the prevalence of scams among the tokens that operate on the Ethereum blockchain. Responding to questions on Twitter, Youssef said Paxful will continue offering trade in stablecoins Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC), but didn\\'t seem too enthused about it. Paxful is a peer-to-peer marketplace which is popular in Africa, a region which Youssef believes will see mass adoption of bitcoin due its financial inclusionary potential. \"In short, our industry is under attack right now, which means our responsibility to protect our users is greater than ever before,\" concluded Youssef.

              "  'If you’re suffering financial abuse and can’t see a way out, there is help out there Financial regulators in Belgium have declared bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ethereum (ETH-USD) should not be classified as securities. The Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) of Belgium released a document on Thursday that stated cryptocurrencies without an issuer are not securities. The regulator specifically identified bitcoin and ethereum as exempt from having to operate as securities within the EU country\\'s financial system. Check: Crypto live prices The document said: \"If there is no issuer, as in cases where instruments are created by a computer code and this is not done in execution of an agreement between issuer and investor, for example, bitcoin or ether, then in principle the Prospectus Regulation, the Prospectus Law and the MiFID rules of conduct do not apply.\" EU-based MiFID rules say that transferable instruments with an issuer are likely to constitute a security. Apart from bitcoin and ethereum, other cryptocurrencies will be designated as having a centralised issuer and so will have to produce an honest prospectus of information for potential investors and adhere to the EU\\'s MiFID rule which requires financiers to avoid conflicts of interest. The exemption of ethereum from securities laws by the Belgian regulator sets a precedent in the development of cryptocurrency regulatory frameworks across the world. In an unusual alliance, both bitcoin maximalists — those that advocate only bitcoin and renounce all other cryptocurrencies — and US regulators argue that ethereum is a security. They point to the presence of a centralised body, called the Ethereum Foundation, and that its issuance can be controlled via updates of the underlying code. However, the Ethereum Foundation states on website that it is a non-profit organisation with a goal of supporting Ethereum and related technologies. The website says: \"The Ethereum Foundation is not a company or even a traditional non-profit. Their role is not to control or lead Ethereum, nor are they the only organisation that funds critical development of Ethereum-related technologies.\" Read more: Doge surges over speculation of Elon Musk and Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin working together',\n",
              "  \"Ether's (ETH) deflationary narrative has ended, at least temporarily. Data from ultrasound.money shows ether’s net issuance – the annualized inflation rate – has risen to 0.07% – after previously dropping below zero amid market volatility linked to the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. A consequent rise in Ethereum network usage had led to millions of dollars in crypto moving on-chain. But the current positive inflation rate indicates that the volume of ether being minted now outpaces the amount that is being burned. Supply has increased 0.14% at an annual rate over the past seven days, according to ultrasound.money. Nick Hotz, vice president of research at the digital-asset management firm Arca, attributed ETH’s deflationary flip to a lack of network activity that led to reduced demand. “Immediately post-FTX, there was tons of demand to swap on both centralized and decentralized exchanges due to volatility,” Hotz told CoinDesk. “In the weeks since, that has faded and now there is very little demand to use neither centralized nor decentralized exchanges.” Crypto market watchers widely expected that Ethereum’s Merge, which shifted the platform’s protocol from proof-of-work (PoW) protocol to a more energy-efficient proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol on Sept. 15 would turn ether deflationary. The upgrade in theory eliminated mining and staking rewards totaling about 1,600 ETH per day – a 90% drop in new issuance. But ether’s inflation rate also depends on a separate mechanism known as the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-1559, where fees paid for transactions on the network are “burned,” or eliminated from circulation. The EIP-1559 is essentially tied to the amount of ether burned with network usage: The more transactions on the blockchain led to more ETH being burnt. According to data from Etherscan, the amount of ETH burnt has spiked as much as 5,000 ETH in a day after FTX’s implosion triggered market jitters. Now the burn rate has slowed to around 1,200 ETH daily. Hotz believes that the mechanism is neither net inflationary nor net deflationary, but rather, it creates “a credible and steady supply of ETH” and sees “more adoption of Ethereum through layer 2 activities.” “It's a lot\",\n",
              "  'Ethereum developers determined on Thursday that the network’s next hard fork, called “Shanghai,” will have a target release time frame of March 2023. This upgrade will include code known as EIP 4895 that will allow Beacon Chain staked ether (ETH) withdrawals. Developers also agreed to address the implementation of the \"EVM Object Format\" (EOF) in Shanghai, which is a collection of EIPs that essentially upgrade the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the environment where Ethereum is able to execute smart contracts. Those Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs) are EIP 3540, EIP 3670, EIP 4200, EIP 4570, EIP 5450. If EOF seems too complicated to implement by the next All Core Developers call planned for Jan. 5, developers agreed they will push back EOF to the fall, so they don’t delay staked ETH withdrawals. Developers also agreed to a second hard fork sometime in the fall of 2023 that would address another significant scaling upgrade – proto-danksharding, also known as EIP 4844. EIP 4844 would make Ethereum more scalable through sharding, a method that splits up the network into “shards” as a way to increase its capacity and bring down gas fees. The two forks will give developers enough time to focus on each issue and alleviate stress for those who have their ETH (and any accrued rewards) locked in the Beacon Chain staking smart contract. Read more: Anxious Ethereum Stakers Question When They’ll Be Able to Access Funds Now that the full scope of what will be included in Shanghai is mostly settled, Ethereum developers will go ahead and work on testing the code. Last month, Ethereum developers launched the Shandong testnet, aimed at resolving any bugs related to some of the EIPs they might have included in Shanghai, but that testnet has now been deprecated. Following Thursday’s call, developers are aiming to launch a new public testnet for Shanghai around Dec.15-16. Ethereum developers will focus their efforts over the next month on making Shanghai as smooth as possible and will aim to start mainnet shadow forks in mid- to late January.  Related Quotes',\n",
